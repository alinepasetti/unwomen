# Equalizer
During the 8-hour hackathon, each group needed to develop an app focused on the 5th sustainable development goal to transform our world by UN: Gender Equality. With the creativity of team members, we achieved an out-of-the-box solution, which guaranteed us the first place.

## How does it work?
- The user enters his name which will be related to the quiz results
- There are 5 questions that they will answer to gather points
- Each question is associated with an answer that aims to educate the user regarding the specific subject
- In the end, the user finds his final result and a list with the best players
- The user can share his result with friends via Whatsapp
- There is a blog page with informative Youtube videos that cover each quiz topic

## About
The website was developed during a hackathon in less than 8 hours and awarded the 1st place. The teams were randomly selected and the team members would bring knowledge from the web development and data analysis area.
